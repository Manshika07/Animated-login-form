This project is an interactive login form featuring an animated avatar that dynamically reacts to user interactions, designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library. The avatar enhances user engagement by responding to inputs in creative ways. As the user types in the email field, the avatarâ€™s eyes, nose, and face follow the caret position, creating a lively and responsive effect. The mouth shape morphs based on the input: it stays small when the field is empty, transitions to medium when typing begins, and becomes large when a valid email structure, such as including an "@" symbol, is detected. For privacy, when the password field is focused, the avatar covers its eyes with its arms, creating a playful yet functional interaction. If the email input is blurred without any text, the avatar resets to its neutral state.
